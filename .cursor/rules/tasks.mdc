# Task List

## Current Sprint - UX Enhancement & Optimization

### User Experience Improvements
- [ ] Implement user feedback collection mechanism for recommendation quality
- [ ] Add loading states and skeleton screens for better perceived performance
- [ ] Enhance error messages with actionable recovery suggestions
- [ ] Implement keyboard shortcuts for tab navigation and milestone progression

### Recommendation System Refinement
- [ ] Analyze recommendation click-through rates and adjust algorithms
- [ ] Implement recommendation filtering by user skill level
- [ ] Add support for contextual recommendations based on dashboard content
- [ ] Create mechanism to hide/dismiss irrelevant recommendations

### Interactive Documentation Enhancement
- [ ] Expand interactive element vocabulary with new action types
- [ ] Implement progress persistence for partially completed tutorials
- [ ] Add visual feedback for completed interactive steps
- [ ] Create fallback content when interactive elements fail requirements

### Technical Improvements
- [ ] Implement comprehensive error boundary with recovery options
- [ ] Add performance monitoring and metrics collection
- [ ] Optimize content caching strategy with intelligent invalidation
- [ ] Add automated accessibility testing to CI pipeline

## Completed Tasks ✅
