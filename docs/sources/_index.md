## Overview

Interactive learning brings contextual documentation and interactive tutorials directly into Grafana, so you can learn and build without leaving your workflow:

- Smart recommendations – Get relevant docs and tutorials based on what you're working on
- Interactive tutorials – Follow step-by-step guided learning journeys with "Show Me" and "Do It" features
- Tab-based navigation – Open multiple docs and tutorials in tabs, just like a browser
- Milestone tracking – See your progress through learning journeys with clear milestones
- Always available – Access help without switching windows or searching documentation sites

Interactive learning is currently available in public preview for Grafana OSS and will soon be arriving to Grafana Cloud.
