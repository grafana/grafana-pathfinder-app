| D1  | Packages are directories containing `content.json`                                    | Natural extension point for assets, sidecars; aligns with SCORM decomposition                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| D2  | Identity: bare globally-unique IDs; `repository` is provenance metadata               | Bare IDs (no repository prefix) enable packages to move between repositories without breaking references. Resolution from bare ID to content location is handled by the package resolver, not by parsing ID syntax. Global uniqueness enforced at build time and catalog aggregation. (Revised from original FQI model `repository/id` — the implementation plan simplified identity to bare IDs.)                                                                                                                                       |

| D4  | All references use bare IDs everywhere                                                | With globally-unique bare IDs (see D2), there is no distinction between same-repo and cross-repo references. All dependency, step, and path references are bare IDs.

| D14 | Separate `content.json` (content) from `manifest.json` (metadata)                     | Follows Debian `control`/`data` separation. Multiple consumers (plugin, recommender, LMS, E2E runner) each need different data; separate files avoid full-parsing a large unified file. Block editor stays focused on content; metadata is managed by different roles with different tools. Eliminates merge conflicts between content and metadata changes.                                                                                                                                                                             |

Asset resolution deferred but convention established now.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| D16 | Flat metadata and dependency fields in `manifest.json`                                | Follows Debian `control` file convention where all fields are peers at the same level. Reduces nesting depth, simplifies authoring and validation. Namespace collision risk is acceptable given the bounded, standards-aligned field inventory (see [namespace collision note](../PATHFINDER-PACKAGE-DESIGN.md#namespace-collision-note)).                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| D17 | CNF OR syntax for dependency lists (nested arrays)                                    | Maps directly to Debian's comma + pipe semantics (`A \| B, C` → `[["A", "B"], "C"]`). Outer array = AND, inner array = OR. Backwards compatible: existing `["A", "B"]` (all strings) retains AND semantics. No string parsing required; fully validatable with Zod.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| D18 | Default `language` to `"en"`                                                          | All existing content is English. Explicit default avoids mandatory boilerplate while preserving the field for future i18n and SCORM import.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| D19 | Defer `estimatedDuration` and `difficulty` to Phase 2+                                | No compelling MVP consumer for either field. No UI component displays them; no recommender logic consumes them. Field names are vetted against IEEE LOM now to avoid future renames. Will be needed if SCORM import or recommendation ranking arrives.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| D20 | Metadata file named `manifest.json`, not `package.json`                               | Avoids collision with Node.js `package.json`, which would cause friction with npm, IDEs, GitHub dependency graphs, and toolchain root detection across 100-200+ guide directories. `manifest.json` is semantically accurate (the file is a manifest of identity, metadata, dependencies, and targeting), parallels SCORM's `imsmanifest.xml`, is familiar to web developers (PWA/extension manifests), and survives the Phase 5 `type` expansion (a manifest for a course is still a manifest). No major toolchain claims this filename. |
| D21 | Journeys use the Debian metapackage model; steps are real packages                    | Package uniformity — one kind of thing, one identity model, one tooling set. Avoids inventing a "sub-unit" concept with scoped identity, fragment notation, or different validation rules. Follows the Debian metapackage precedent for composing coherent experiences from discrete components. Enables step reuse across journeys (the "flavors" advantage visible in the integration journeys that share `install-alloy`, `configure-alloy`, and `install-dashboards-alerts`).                                                        |
| D22 | `type` discriminator pulled forward with `"guide"` and `"journey"`                    | Journeys need the type discriminator now. Originally deferred to Phase 5 for SCORM. The journey `type` establishes the composition pattern that SCORM's `"course"` and `"module"` types will refine, not a separate system.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| D23 | `steps` is a new ordered array of bare package IDs, not a Debian dependency construct | Debian `Depends` has no ordering semantics — `A, B, C` is conjunction, not sequence. Advisory linear ordering requires new machinery layered on top of the Debian model. The `steps` array contains bare package IDs resolved via the repository index (not directory names). It is the single source of truth for step ordering; not dependency chains, not filesystem ordering, not a separate paths file.                                                                                                                             |
| D24 | Step ordering is advisory; journey completion is set-based                            | Users can jump into any step directly. Completion = all steps done, regardless of order. The `steps` array is the suggested reading path, not an enforcement mechanism. This matches the design constraint that journeys should encourage but not require sequential progression.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| D25 | Nested package directories are permitted but not required                             | Journey-specific steps may be nested as child directories of their journey (organizational convenience). Shared steps that appear in multiple journeys live as independent top-level packages — following the Debian convention where metapackage dependencies are independently located in the pool, not physically contained. The `steps` array uses bare package IDs resolved via the repository index regardless of physical location. The CLI must handle directory-within-directory package structure but does not require it.     |
| D26 | Package ids do not encode filesystem paths                                            | Coupling identity to physical layout means any directory reorganization changes the id, cascading into every package that references it in `depends`, `recommends`, `steps`, or any other field. Ids are stable flat tokens; the mapping from id to path is an external concern handled by the repository index.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| D27 | Repository-level `repository.json` with denormalized manifest metadata                | Follows the Debian `Packages` index precedent. Each repository publishes a compiled `repository.json` mapping bare package IDs to relative filesystem paths and denormalized manifest metadata (`title`, `type`, `description`, `category`, `startingLocation`, dependency arrays). Denormalization enables dependency graph building and catalog search from the index alone. (Revised from original path-only format — denormalization was adopted because the file is a compiled artifact that cannot diverge from source.)           |
| D28 | `repository.json` is compiled, never hand-authored                                    | Generated by `pathfinder-cli build-repository`, regenerated by pre-commit hook, verified in CI by rebuild-and-diff. Follows the lockfile pattern: committed for fast reads, always reproducible from source. The compiled nature of this file is what makes denormalization safe — the source of truth remains each package's `manifest.json`.                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| D29 | `provides` creates virtual capabilities following Debian semantics                    | Virtual capability names declared in `provides` do NOT need to exist as real packages. This follows the Debian virtual package model: `mail-transport-agent` is provided by `postfix`, `exim4`, etc. but does not exist as a real package. Dependency targets are resolved by checking both real package IDs and virtual capabilities. The graph builder constructs a provides map and uses it during lint and resolution. (Added to resolve a contradiction between the dependency design and the original Phase 1 lint rules.)         |
