# Design Docs

This directory exists for design & architecture ideas; a stable source of early planning
material for comment & evolution.

**Files in this directory do not necessarily represent implemented reality and are not
documentation** - they are early design thinking for iteration.  As designs are implemented,
consider removing the design document and phasing its reality into documentation.
