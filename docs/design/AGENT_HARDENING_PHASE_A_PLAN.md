# Agent hardening — Phase A implementation plan

Branch: `agent-hardening/phase-a`
Source design doc: [`docs/design/AGENT_HARDENING.md`](AGENT_HARDENING.md)
Scope: Phase A only (items A1–A5). Phases B–E are explicitly out of scope.

## Context

`docs/design/AGENT_HARDENING.md` is an architectural audit identifying twelve verified findings (F-1 through F-12) where the agent-operating layer of this repo (`AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.cursor/rules/`, `.cursor/skills/`, `CONCERNS.md`, …) is out of sync with the code it describes. Phase A targets the five cheapest, highest-correctness items — all of them prose fixes plus one new test — under the banner "stop lying to the agent." The design doc itself recommends Phase A as a single PR before any mechanical-enforcement work begins.

Concrete state captured during exploration (so executors do not re-derive it):

- **Tier numbering is inverted between docs and code.** `src/validation/import-graph.ts:20-40` defines 5 tiers (0–4) with engines at Tier 2, support libs at Tier 1, components/pages at Tier 4. `AGENTS.md:68-75` and `.cursor/rules/systemPatterns.mdc:85-92` describe 4 tiers (0–3) with engines at Tier 1, UI at Tier 2, support at Tier 3. Reconciliation must adopt the code's numbering (it is the executable source of truth).
- **F-code definitions disagree, not just drift.** `frontend-security.mdc:14-155` defines F1=untrusted SVG, F2=safe React bindings, F3=URLs as objects, F4=sanitize HTML, F5=insecure DOM, F6=URL validation. `pr-review.md:240-245` has F1 and F2 swapped (its F1 = "dangerouslySetInnerHTML" matches canonical F4; its F2 = "untrusted SVG" matches canonical F1). `secure/SKILL.md:50-61` aligns with `frontend-security.mdc`. The design doc proposed `CONCERNS.md` as source of truth, but `CONCERNS.md` does not actually define F-codes — it only routes to `frontend-security.mdc`. **This plan designates `frontend-security.mdc` as canonical** since that is what the codebase already treats as authoritative.
- **`prevent-doc-drift` references stale section names.** `.cursor/skills/prevent-doc-drift/SKILL.md:267` mentions "Subsystem tiers and key relationships" — a section name that exists in neither current `AGENTS.md` nor post-A1 `AGENTS.md`. Real AGENTS.md sections are "Frontend tier model" and "Frontend subsystem reference."
- **CONTEXT_INDEX overstates auto-load.** `docs/developer/CONTEXT_INDEX.md:3` says "Many are auto-triggered by glob patterns in `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` frontmatter." In Claude Code this is false — Cursor honors `globs:`/`alwaysApply:`, Claude Code does not. `CLAUDE.md:108` repeats the claim for `frontend-security.mdc`.
- **No tier-doc-sync test exists.** `src/validation/architecture.test.ts` (315 lines) enforces tier rules in code but never reads any `.md`/`.mdc` file. A2's test is net-new but plugs naturally into the existing test file (it already imports `TIER_MAP` and has a "Tier map completeness" describe block at lines 158-198 that is the obvious neighbour for the new test).

## Scope

**In scope (Phase A only):**

- A1 — Reconcile tier model docs with `TIER_MAP`
- A2 — Add tier-doc-sync test
- A3 — Fix `prevent-doc-drift` stale section references
- A4 — F-code consistency audit + cross-file alignment
- A5 — Fix `CONTEXT_INDEX.md` / `CLAUDE.md` auto-load claims

**Out of scope on this branch (deferred to later branches):**

- Phase B mechanical enforcement (Stop hooks, concentration ratchet, ESLint/TIER_MAP sync, alias coverage, husky tightening, `--coverage=false` UX)
- Phase C governance suite + observability
- Phase D threat model + least-agency
- Phase E maturity moves
- Any change to product code under `src/components/`, `src/context-engine/`, etc. (Phase A is documentation + one test only.)

## Execution model and status tracking

Each task block below has a **Status** line. Any agent picking up a task MUST:

1. Set Status to `in-progress (<agent-name>, <YYYY-MM-DD>)` before doing work.
2. Fill in `Files touched`, `Notes`, and any deviations from the plan when work completes.
3. Set Status to `done (<agent-name>, <YYYY-MM-DD>, commit <sha>)` after the commit lands.
4. Update `## Overall progress` at the top of the file.

Sub-checkboxes inside each task are for the executing agent to tick off as they go.

## Pre-flight — land design doc + plan on branch

**Status:** done (Claude Opus 4.7, 2026-05-20, commit 7507c04b)

**Why first:** The design doc is currently untracked on `main`. Both it and this plan need to be on the branch before tasks A1–A5 run so executors can reference them by path.

**Steps:**

- [x] Copy plan file to `docs/design/AGENT_HARDENING_PHASE_A_PLAN.md`
- [x] `git add docs/design/AGENT_HARDENING.md docs/design/AGENT_HARDENING_PHASE_A_PLAN.md`
- [x] Commit with message: `docs(agent-hardening): add Phase A design doc and implementation plan`
- [x] Record SHA in Notes below

**Files touched:**

- `docs/design/AGENT_HARDENING.md` (new, moved from untracked)
- `docs/design/AGENT_HARDENING_PHASE_A_PLAN.md` (new)

**Notes:**

- Pre-commit hook (lint-staged + prettier) reformatted the markdown to normalize wrapping and spacing. No content changes. Committed in the same SHA.

## A1 — Reconcile tier model docs with `TIER_MAP`

**Status:** done (Claude Opus 4.7, 2026-05-20, commit 7a11cb35)
**Effort:** 2–4h
**Depends on:** Pre-flight
**Citation:** F-1 in AGENT_HARDENING.md

**Goal:** `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.cursor/rules/systemPatterns.mdc`, and `docs/developer/CONTEXT_INDEX.md` all describe the same tier model that `src/validation/import-graph.ts` enforces.

**Canonical tier model (from `src/validation/import-graph.ts:20-40` — adopt verbatim):**

```
Tier 0 — Types & constants: types, constants
Tier 1 — Support: lib, security, styles, global-state, utils, validation, recovery
Tier 2 — Engines & hooks: context-engine, docs-retrieval, interactive-engine,
         requirements-manager, learning-paths, package-engine, hooks
Tier 3 — Integrations: integrations
Tier 4 — UI: components, pages
```

Plus the excluded set (not tiered, excluded from analysis): `test-utils`, `cli`, `bundled-interactives`, `img`, `locales`.

**Steps:**

- [x] Rewrite `AGENTS.md:68-75` ("Frontend tier model" bullet list) to use 5-tier numbering above
- [x] Update `AGENTS.md:98-133` ("Frontend subsystem reference" section) to label each subsystem with its corrected tier number — AGENTS.md has no such section; the subsystem catalogue lives only in `.cursor/rules/systemPatterns.mdc` (covered by the next step)
- [x] Rewrite `.cursor/rules/systemPatterns.mdc:85-92` to match (currently 4-tier prose, same content shape as AGENTS.md)
- [x] Update `.cursor/rules/systemPatterns.mdc` subsystem reference section (line 133+) tier labels
- [x] Scan `CLAUDE.md` for any tier references (exploration found none, but verify) — none found
- [x] Scan `docs/developer/CONTEXT_INDEX.md` for tier references — none found
- [x] Spot-check `docs/developer/` deep-dives for tier mentions: `engines/`, `utils/README.md`, `constants/README.md`, `learning-paths/README.md` — only hits are content-fetch fallback tiers in `engines/context-engine.md` and an E2E test-attribute tier in `E2E_TESTING_CONTRACT.md`, both unrelated to the import-tier model
- [x] Run `rg -n "Tier [0-3]" --type md AGENTS.md CLAUDE.md docs/ .cursor/rules/` to confirm no stale 4-tier references remain
- [x] Commit: `docs(agent-hardening): reconcile tier model prose with import-graph TIER_MAP (A1)`

**Acceptance criteria:**

- Tier counts, numbers, and group memberships agree across `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.cursor/rules/systemPatterns.mdc`, `docs/developer/CONTEXT_INDEX.md`, and `src/validation/import-graph.ts`.
- `npm run test:ci -- src/validation/architecture.test.ts --coverage=false` still passes (this task does not touch test code).

**Files touched:**

- `AGENTS.md` — rewrote the "Frontend tier model" bullet list (lines 68–78) to the 5-tier model and added an "Excluded from tier analysis" line plus pointer to `TIER_MAP`.
- `.cursor/rules/systemPatterns.mdc` — rewrote the tier-model bullet list (lines 85–95) and reorganized the "Frontend subsystem reference" section (lines 96–135): every subsystem now lives under the correct tier header, `hooks` moves up to Tier 2 with the engines, `integrations` gets its own Tier 3 block, and `test-utils`/`cli`/`bundled-interactives`/`locales`/`img` are split into a clearly-labeled "Excluded from tier analysis" group.

**Notes:**

- AGENTS.md does not contain a "Frontend subsystem reference" section (the per-subsystem catalogue lives only in `.cursor/rules/systemPatterns.mdc`). The plan's step referencing `AGENTS.md:98-133` was a misread of the file; the equivalent edits landed in `systemPatterns.mdc` instead. Noted in the step checkbox.
- `CLAUDE.md` and `docs/developer/CONTEXT_INDEX.md` have no tier-number references — left untouched.
- `docs/developer/engines/context-engine.md` mentions "Tier 1/2/3" but those refer to the content-fetch fallback strategy (external recommender → bundled → static links), not the import-graph tier model — left untouched.
- `docs/developer/E2E_TESTING_CONTRACT.md:259` mentions "Tier 2 attribute" referring to E2E selector attribute classification — unrelated to import tiers, left untouched.
- `docs/history/package-implementation-record.md` already uses the correct 5-tier numbering (it was written after `validation` was moved to Tier 1) — left untouched.
- The pre-commit hook (lint-staged + prettier) ran but produced no changes for the two edited files.
- `AGENTS.md` has a "Key dependency edges" table listing `recovery → requirements-manager`. Under the new tier model, recovery (Tier 1) cannot import from requirements-manager (Tier 2). Verified via `rg`: `src/recovery/` only imports from `types/` (Tier 0), so the table entry describes a conceptual recovery-vs-requirements relationship rather than an actual code-level edge. The architecture test still passes. Leaving as-is — clarifying that table is outside A1's scope and the test wouldn't catch it; flag for a future cleanup pass if desired.
- Verification: `npm run test:ci -- src/validation/architecture.test.ts --coverage=false` passed (7/7 tests, ratchet still `vertical=4 lateral=9 barrel=0`).

## A2 — Tier-doc-sync test

**Status:** done (Claude Opus 4.7, 2026-05-20, commit cf9afb2d)
**Effort:** 1–2h
**Depends on:** A1
**Citation:** F-1 prevention (so A1 cannot regress)

**Goal:** A test that parses the tier prose in `AGENTS.md` and `.cursor/rules/systemPatterns.mdc` and fails if it disagrees with `TIER_MAP`.

**Decision: extend `src/validation/architecture.test.ts` rather than creating a new `governance.test.ts`.** Rationale: the existing file already imports `TIER_MAP` and has a "Tier map completeness" `describe` block at lines 158-198 — the new test is the natural cousin. Creating a separate file duplicates Jest config wiring for one test.

**Implementation sketch:**

- Add a new `describe('Tier documentation sync', ...)` block after line 314.
- Read `AGENTS.md` and `.cursor/rules/systemPatterns.mdc` via `fs.readFileSync`.
- Parse the tier bullet list out of each file with a regex anchored to the section heading. Be tolerant of formatting (extra whitespace, backticks around dir names).
- Assert: every entry in `TIER_MAP` appears in each doc with the matching tier number; no doc lists a directory that is not in `TIER_MAP`.
- Provide a clear failure message naming the divergent directory and the two tier values.

**Steps:**

- [x] Draft the parser (small, regex-based, no new deps)
- [x] Add the describe block in `src/validation/architecture.test.ts`
- [x] Confirm the test passes against post-A1 docs
- [x] Confirm the test fails if you temporarily flip a tier in `AGENTS.md` (manual sanity check; revert) — replaced with permanent in-test regression coverage (approach b in the task brief)
- [x] Run `npm run test:ci -- src/validation/architecture.test.ts --coverage=false`
- [x] Commit: `test(validation): assert tier docs stay in sync with TIER_MAP (A2)`

**Acceptance criteria:**

- Test runs as part of `npm run test:ci`.
- Test fails on any tier doc/code divergence with a clear message.
- No new npm dependencies added.

**Files touched:**

- `src/validation/architecture.test.ts` — added a `Tier documentation sync` describe block (~200 lines) with a `parseTierDoc` helper, a `diffTierMaps` / `diffExcludedSets` comparator pair, an `it.each` parameterized test over `AGENTS.md` and `.cursor/rules/systemPatterns.mdc`, plus two permanent parser unit tests that feed in hand-crafted markdown with known-wrong directories. Built-in `fs` / `path` only; no new deps.

**Notes:**

- Picked sanity-check approach **(b)**: two permanent in-test cases (`flags a divergent tier when doc and TIER_MAP disagree`, `flags a directory listed in the doc but missing from TIER_MAP`) exercise the comparison logic against hand-crafted bad markdown. Approach (a) would have required a transient `git checkout` round-trip with no lasting coverage; (b) was strictly more valuable.
- Parser anchors to the `Frontend tier model` heading and slices the section up to the next heading of the same or shallower depth. This isolates the tier-model bullet list from systemPatterns.mdc's more elaborate `Frontend subsystem reference` catalogue further down (which mentions the same directory names under different headings).
- Tricky parser case: `systemPatterns.mdc` puts a one-sentence description after the dir list on the same bullet line (`... `package-engine/`, `hooks/`. Hold the business logic. Each engine exposes a barrel `index.ts`; ...`). Initial implementation greedily picked up `index.ts` as a tier-2 directory and failed the test on systemPatterns.mdc. Fixed by truncating the matched bullet payload at the first `. ` (period+whitespace) before tokenizing — dir lists are comma-separated, so this cleanly drops the trailing prose. AGENTS.md doesn't have this trailing prose and is unaffected by the change.
- Free bonus: the test also validates the excluded set (`test-utils`, `cli`, `bundled-interactives`, `img`, `locales`) against `EXCLUDED_TOP_LEVEL` in `import-graph.ts`. Both docs document this list, and both currently match, so the coverage was effectively free.
- Pre-commit hook (prettier) ran but produced no further changes for the test file.
- Final run: 11/11 tests pass; ratchet still `vertical=4 lateral=9 barrel=0`.

## A3 — Fix `prevent-doc-drift` stale section references

**Status:** done (Claude Opus 4.7, 2026-05-20, commit 38ded7b4)
**Effort:** 2h
**Depends on:** A1 (so updated section content can be referenced if needed)
**Citation:** F-2

**Goal:** Every section name referenced in `.cursor/skills/prevent-doc-drift/SKILL.md` exists in its target doc.

**Known stale reference (from exploration):**

- Line 267: `AGENTS.md "Subsystem tiers and key relationships"` — should be `AGENTS.md "Frontend tier model"` (for tier-list adjustments) or `AGENTS.md "Frontend subsystem reference"` (for per-subsystem entries). Decide which fits the example context.
- Line 267: "Tier-1 list" wording — after A1 lands, the new tier-1 entries are `lib`, `security`, `styles`, `global-state`, `utils`, `validation`, `recovery`. Engines are now Tier-2. Update the example accordingly.

**Steps:**

- [x] Walk the entire `prevent-doc-drift/SKILL.md` (319 lines) and extract every quoted section reference (e.g., `"Code organization"`, `"Frontend subsystem reference"`, `"On-demand context"`, `"HTTP resource API"`, etc.)
- [x] For each reference, `grep` the target doc(s) for the section heading; flag mismatches
- [x] Rewrite mismatches; update examples whose "Detected updates" outputs reference the now-corrected tier numbers from A1
- [x] Cross-check that example PRs in the skill still type-check against the rules table at lines 79-101
- [x] Commit: `docs(prevent-doc-drift): align section references and tier examples with current docs (A3)`

**Acceptance criteria:**

- Every section name referenced in `prevent-doc-drift/SKILL.md` resolves to an existing heading in its target file.
- Example outputs (Example 1, 2, 3 in the skill) reflect the post-A1 tier numbering.

**Files touched:**

- `.cursor/skills/prevent-doc-drift/SKILL.md` — rewrote the rules table (lines 79–101), the tier-detection heuristics (lines ~199–215), the "new frontend subsystem" heuristic bullet (line 193), and Examples 1–3 (lines 251–300). Net: 36 insertions / 37 deletions after prettier.

**Notes:**

- Audited 17 quoted section references in the rules table + 6 in the worked examples (23 total). Of those, ~10 needed fixes: every `AGENTS.md "Subsystem tiers and key relationships"` hit (none — section never existed), every `AGENTS.md "Local development commands"` hit (actual section is "Essential commands" at AGENTS.md:53; AGENTS.md intentionally keeps only a short essentials list and links to `docs/developer/COMMANDS.md` as the canonical full reference), every `AGENTS.md "Backend request paths"`/`"HTTP resource API"`/`"Stream message types"` hit (no such sub-headings in AGENTS.md — the `pkg/` section is a single prose paragraph; the per-file catalogue + stream-type list lives in `.cursor/rules/systemPatterns.mdc` "Backend architecture (\`pkg/\`)" at lines 161/205), and the `AGENTS.md "Tiered rule architecture"` hit (no such section).
- Routing strategy: redirected per-subsystem / per-file catalogue edits to `systemPatterns.mdc`; redirected per-command/per-flag/per-test-id edits to the appropriate `docs/developer/` file or `CONTEXT_INDEX.md`. AGENTS.md edits are now reserved for the short, load-bearing surfaces (Frontend tier model bullet list, Key dependency edges, Essential commands, On-demand context frequently-needed list).
- Tier-number examples updated:
  - Example 1 (skill lines 264–267): "Tier-1 list" → "Tier 2 bullet (engines & hooks)" — engines moved from Tier 1 to Tier 2 in the new 5-tier model.
  - Tier-detection heuristics (skill lines 199–215): "Tier-1 markers (engines/providers)" → "Tier 2 markers"; "Tier-3 markers (support utilities)" → "Tier 1 markers"; "default to Tier 3" → "default to Tier 1"; added explicit cross-reference to `TIER_MAP` and a note that `recovery` actually lives in Tier 1 (not Tier 2) despite the `-engine`-ish naming because it only depends on `types/`.
- Skill detection bullet (line 193): "Code organization list" → "Frontend tier model bullet list" — small precision fix; the subsystem listing under "Code organization" is specifically the bullet list inside the "Frontend tier model" subsection, not the heading itself.
- Ambiguity worth flagging (not fixed here, outside A3 scope): AGENTS.md `pkg/` summary mentions the three primary request paths but contains no per-route or per-stream-type list. If a future PR adds a fourth fundamentally different request path, AGENTS.md prose may need a sentence update — the rules table now defers all per-file/per-route work to `systemPatterns.mdc` but recommends an AGENTS.md prose update if the "three primary request paths" framing changes. Captured in Example 3's "no edit needed unless …" wording.
- Verification: `npm run test:ci -- src/validation/architecture.test.ts --coverage=false` passed (11/11; ratchet still `vertical=4 lateral=9 barrel=0`).
- Pre-commit hook (prettier) reformatted the rules table for column alignment after the row rewrites. No content changes — just whitespace.

## A4 — F-code consistency audit + alignment

**Status:** done (Claude Opus 4.7, 2026-05-20, commit 26542faa)
**Effort:** 3–4h
**Depends on:** —
**Citation:** F-4

**Goal:** F1–F6 have a single canonical definition; all other references either cite the canonical file by path or use matching IDs and one-line summaries.

**Canonical source: `.cursor/rules/frontend-security.mdc`** (deviation from design-doc note; rationale in Context section above — `CONCERNS.md` does not define F-codes, only routes to them; `frontend-security.mdc` is what the codebase already treats as canonical with Do/Don't examples and remediation patterns).

**Canonical numbering (from `frontend-security.mdc:14-155`):**

| ID  | Title                        | Lines   |
| --- | ---------------------------- | ------- |
| F1  | Avoid Untrusted SVGs         | 14–31   |
| F2  | Use Safe React Data Bindings | 35–50   |
| F3  | Don't Treat URLs as Strings  | 54–91   |
| F4  | Sanitize HTML and URLs       | 95–121  |
| F5  | Avoid Insecure DOM APIs      | 124–148 |
| F6  | Global URL & Link Validation | 152–155 |

**Known divergence to fix:**

- `.cursor/rules/pr-review.md:240-245` — F1 and F2 are swapped relative to canonical (and F3–F6 may also drift). Detection-table entries must match canonical IDs.
- `.cursor/skills/secure/SKILL.md:50-61` — already aligned; verify and leave alone.
- `docs/design/CONCERNS.md` — does not redefine F-codes today. Should add a one-line pointer ("F-codes are defined in `.cursor/rules/frontend-security.mdc`") for discoverability.

**Steps:**

- [x] Re-read `frontend-security.mdc` and confirm the table above
- [x] Rewrite `.cursor/rules/pr-review.md:240-245` detection table so F1–F6 match canonical IDs and short summaries
- [x] Verify `.cursor/skills/secure/SKILL.md:50-61` against canonical; fix any drift
- [x] Add a one-line pointer to `frontend-security.mdc` in `docs/design/CONCERNS.md` near the `security` concern entry (do not redefine F-codes there)
- [x] `rg -n 'F[1-6]\b' --type md .cursor/ docs/` and confirm every hit either lives in `frontend-security.mdc` or matches its IDs
- [x] Commit: `docs(security): align F-code IDs across pr-review, secure skill, and CONCERNS (A4)`

**Acceptance criteria:**

- Each of F1–F6 has exactly one definition site (`frontend-security.mdc`).
- All other references match by ID and short summary.
- `rg -n 'F[1-6]\b'` shows no contradictions.

**Files touched:**

- `.cursor/rules/pr-review.md` — rewrote the F1–F6 rows in the Unified detection table (lines 240–245) to match canonical IDs and short summaries. Prettier reflowed the column widths in the same commit; no content drift from the intended rewrite.
- `.cursor/skills/secure/SKILL.md` — extended the F5 row description to include "or dynamic `script.src` assignment" so it matches the canonical "Forbidden" list in `frontend-security.mdc:127-131`. No ID changes — the IDs were already aligned with canonical.
- `docs/design/CONCERNS.md` — added a "Canonical rule sources" callout (4 lines) between the existing "Coverage-gap detection" section and the first `---` separator, stating that `frontend-security.mdc` is the canonical F1–F6 definition site and that `pr-review.md` / `secure/SKILL.md` are reference-only. Did not add F-code definitions inline (intentional per task brief).

**Notes:**

- **Pre/post F-code mapping in `.cursor/rules/pr-review.md`** (canonical = what `frontend-security.mdc` defines under each ID):

  | ID  | Pre (drifted) wording                                       | Canonical match | Post (aligned) wording                                                         |
  | --- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
  | F1  | `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` without sanitization              | canonical F4    | Untrusted/dynamic SVG without DOMPurify sanitization                           |
  | F2  | Untrusted/dynamic SVG without DOMPurify                     | canonical F1    | `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` where `{}` auto-escape would do                      |
  | F3  | Dynamic text rendered via innerHTML instead of `{}`         | canonical F2    | URL built via string concat instead of `new URL()` + searchParams              |
  | F4  | URL built via string concatenation instead of `URL` API     | canonical F3    | `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` without `textUtil.sanitize()`                        |
  | F5  | Use of `innerHTML`, `outerHTML`, `insertAdjacentHTML`       | canonical F5 ✓  | Use of `.innerHTML`, `.outerHTML`, `.insertAdjacentHTML`, dynamic `script.src` |
  | F6  | Unvalidated URL scheme (`javascript:`, `data:`) in link/img | canonical F6 ≈  | URL in `href`/`src` without `textUtil.sanitizeUrl()` or scheme-allowlist check |

  Four rows (F1–F4) were ID-mismatched relative to canonical; F5 was correct but missing the "dynamic `script.src`" sub-case; F6 was conceptually correct but reworded to match canonical's wording ("URL & Link Validation" via `textUtil.sanitizeUrl()` / scheme-allowlist, rather than describing only the `javascript:`/`data:` sub-case). The swap was a clean rewrite — no row was deleted or added; only IDs and summaries shifted.

- **`.cursor/skills/secure/SKILL.md`** — already aligned with canonical IDs (F1=SVG, F2=safe React bindings, F3=URL constructor, F4=sanitize HTML, F5=insecure DOM, F6=URL validation). Single non-ID fix: F5 row extended to mention dynamic `script.src` for parity with the canonical "Forbidden" list. The F-code references in detection-rules prose (`For F1 / F4`, `For F3`, `For F5`, `For F6` at lines 65–68) all match canonical semantics — left untouched.
- **Canonical-source pointer in `CONCERNS.md`** — added as a new "Canonical rule sources" subsection at line 34 (between the existing "Coverage-gap detection" section and the first `---` separator). Wording: "F1–F6 security rules are defined in `.cursor/rules/frontend-security.mdc`. Other files (`.cursor/rules/pr-review.md`, `.cursor/skills/secure/SKILL.md`) reference these IDs without redefining them — if the summaries diverge, `frontend-security.mdc` wins." Placed in the prelude rather than inline in the `security` row's `load_docs` column because the table format does not support inline notes and the prelude is where someone routing security review or wondering "what is F3?" naturally lands.
- **Stragglers flagged but not fixed on this branch:**
  - `docs/history/package-implementation-record.md:321` references "(F4 security rule)" for a code-site using `new URL()` construction. Canonical F4 is "Sanitize HTML and URLs"; `new URL()` is canonical F3 ("Don't Treat URLs as Strings"). This is a wrong F-code citation in a historical implementation record. Out of scope for A4 (history docs are not normative agent guidance), and fixing it would require a separate "history-doc accuracy" pass.
  - `.cursor/local/REMOVE-HTML-DYNAMICS.md:495-612` uses old F-code groupings: "F1/F2 (HTML sanitization)", "F3/F4 (URL safety)", "F5 (No unsafe DOM APIs)", "F6 (No dangerouslySetInnerHTML in parser)". None of these match canonical (F1=SVG, F2=safe React bindings, F4=HTML sanitization, F6=URL validation). However, `.cursor/local/` is gitignored (see `.gitignore`: `.cursor/local`), so this file is not part of the canonical agent-facing surface and not touched.
  - `docs/design/AGENT_HARDENING.md:55,102` mentions F-codes in the audit narrative ("F-4 F1–F6 security-rule IDs lack cross-file consistency audit", "Cross-reference F1–F6 …"). These are historical/planning commentary describing _the audit_, not normative rule definitions. Per the task brief, left in place.
- **Re the "Escalation pointers" wording** in `pr-review.md:257` ("F1-F6 hit: `frontend-security.mdc` is already loaded (always-apply). Reference it directly.") — still accurate post-swap; the pointer references the file, not specific IDs. Same for the comment-prefix table at line 277 ("`[security]` | Security concern (F1-F6)"). Both left untouched.
- **The "(always-apply)" phrasing in pr-review.md:257** technically overstates Claude Code behavior — it is Cursor-specific. That is exactly the surface A5 will tighten; out of scope for A4.
- Verification: `npm run test:ci -- src/validation/architecture.test.ts --coverage=false` passed (11/11; ratchet still `vertical=4 lateral=9 barrel=0`).
- Pre-commit hook (lint-staged + prettier) ran on the content commit and reflowed the `pr-review.md` detection-table column widths after the rewrite. No content drift — only whitespace alignment.

## A5 — Fix `CONTEXT_INDEX.md` / `CLAUDE.md` auto-load claims

**Status:** not-started
**Effort:** 2–3h
**Depends on:** —
**Citation:** F-3

**Goal:** No doc implies Claude Code auto-loads `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` files by glob. Cursor-specific behavior is called out as such.

**Known false claims to fix:**

- `docs/developer/CONTEXT_INDEX.md:3` — "Many are auto-triggered by glob patterns in `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` frontmatter; the rest are loaded by name."
- `CLAUDE.md:108` — "`.cursor/rules/frontend-security.mdc` — frontend security F1-F6 (auto-triggered on `*.ts`/`*.tsx`/`*.js`/`*.jsx`)"
- The "Auto-triggered by globs" column in `CONTEXT_INDEX.md` tables (`tracked-step-types.mdc`, `schema-coupling.mdc`, `frontend-security.mdc`, `testingStrategy.mdc`, `coda.mdc`) — these claims describe Cursor behavior, not Claude Code behavior.

**Rewrite strategy:**

- Preamble (`CONTEXT_INDEX.md:3-5`): replace "auto-triggered by glob patterns" with explicit "In Cursor, many `.mdc` files auto-load via `globs:` frontmatter. In Claude Code, these are discoverable-only — load them by name when working in the relevant domain. The 'Auto-triggered by globs' column documents the Cursor behavior for cross-tool reference."
- Per-row entries can keep the globs column (useful information) but the preamble must make clear it is Cursor-only metadata.
- `CLAUDE.md:108`: replace "auto-triggered on …" with "load when working in `*.ts`/`*.tsx`/`*.js`/`*.jsx` files".

**Steps:**

- [ ] Rewrite preamble at `CONTEXT_INDEX.md:3-5`
- [ ] Rewrite the table column header or add a note explaining the column is Cursor metadata
- [ ] Rewrite `CLAUDE.md:108` (frontend-security entry)
- [ ] `rg -n 'auto-triggered|auto-load|alwaysApply' --type md AGENTS.md CLAUDE.md docs/ .cursor/` and audit each hit
- [ ] Commit: `docs(context-index): clarify that .mdc glob auto-load is Cursor-only, not Claude Code (A5)`

**Acceptance criteria:**

- No doc implies Claude Code auto-loads `.mdc` rules by glob.
- The actual cross-tool behavior (Cursor: glob auto-load; Claude Code: explicit citation) is documented.

## Final verification

**Status:** not-started
**Depends on:** A1–A5 all done

**Steps:**

- [ ] `npm run check` passes (typecheck + lint + prettier + lint:go + test:go + test:ci)
- [ ] `git log --oneline main..HEAD` shows the expected commit shape (pre-flight + 5 task commits + optional plan-update commit)
- [ ] `## Overall progress` checklist above is fully ticked
- [ ] Plan file's `Files touched` and `Notes` sections are filled in for every task
- [ ] Branch ready for PR (PR creation itself is out of scope for this branch — that comes later)
