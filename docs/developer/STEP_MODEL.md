# Step model — canonical shape end to end

How a single interactive step flows from authored JSON to the engine action that drives Grafana's UI. Each row is a representation; each transition is the function that produces the next form.

| Layer          | Representation                                                                                      | Field naming                       | Owner                                |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Author content | JSON block (`action`, `reftarget`, `targetvalue`, `tooltip`, `requirements[]`, optional `id`)       | lowercase, dashed where applicable | `src/types/json-guide.schema.ts`     |
| Parsed IR      | `ParsedElement.props` (`targetAction`, `refTarget`, `targetValue`, `targetComment`, `requirements`) | camelCase                          | `src/docs-retrieval/json-parser.ts`  |
| React props    | `InteractiveStepProps`, `InteractiveSectionProps`, etc.                                             | camelCase                          | `src/types/component-props.types.ts` |
| Engine payload | `InteractiveElementData` (`targetAction`, `refTarget`, `targetValue`, `targetComment`)              | camelCase                          | `src/types/interactive.types.ts`     |
| DOM attributes | `data-targetaction`, `data-reftarget`, `data-targetvalue`                                           | dashed-lowercase per W3C           | DOM, dev tooling                     |

The JSON authoring layer and the DOM-attribute layer keep their lowercase forms (external conventions); every JS object in between is camelCase.

## JSON field aliasing

The canonical JSON form is lowercase (`action`, `reftarget`, `targetvalue`). The runtime parser additionally tolerates the camelCase aliases (`targetAction`, `refTarget`, `targetValue`) on raw JSON input — when both are present, the lowercase form wins; when only the camelCase alias is set, the Zod validator still rejects the guide (CLI flag generation depends on the canonical-only schema). Schema-level acceptance of camelCase aliases is a deliberate follow-up.

Authors can also write an explicit `id` on an interactive block; the parser plumbs it through to `ParsedElement.props.stepId`, overriding the section's positional `${sectionId}-step-N` convention. This is the recommended path for stable `section-completed:` requirement targets.

## Completion store — canonical persistence

Step completion lives in `src/global-state/completion-store.ts`. The store is the canonical persistence layer — `SectionState` no longer carries a parallel `completed` set, and step components no longer maintain a local `isLocallyCompleted` flag. The store backs the existing `interactiveStepStorage` namespace so localStorage shape is preserved.

The step-checker FSM (`src/requirements-manager/step-checker.hook.ts`) and the `SequentialRequirementsManager` orchestrator remain as mirrors of the store — they hold the in-memory checking state needed to drive the UI. The FSM writes through to the store on every terminal transition (manual completion, skipped, objectives auto-complete, and reset) via `writeStoreCompletion` / `writeStoreReset`, so the orchestration mirrors and the canonical store cannot disagree on either axis. The `step-checker.store-bridge.test.ts` tripwire pins this contract.

Public API:

- `useStepCompletion(stepId, sectionId?)` — `useSyncExternalStore`-backed live read for a single step.
- `useSectionCompletion(sectionId)` — `ReadonlySet<string>` of completed step IDs for the section, stable identity between renders that didn't change membership.
- `markStepCompleted(stepId, sectionId | undefined, reason)` — single-step write.
- `resetStep(stepId, sectionId?)` — single-step clear.
- `markStepsCompleted(stepIds, sectionId, reason?)` — atomic bulk write (used by the section's objectives-auto-complete and run-section paths).
- `resetSteps(stepIds, sectionId)` — atomic tail-reset used by the section's individual-step redo path.
- `resetSection(sectionId)` — atomic clear used by the section's full-reset path.
- `getGuideProgress(contentKey)` — `{ completed, total, percentage }` snapshot.
- `evictSectionCache(sectionId)` — drop a section's cache + hydration marker without writing storage. Called by `InteractiveSection`'s preview-mode unmount path so a remount under the same preview key starts fresh.
- `evictContentCache(contentKey)` — drop one content key's cache + hydration state + version counters. Called by per-guide reset paths so subscribers re-render against an empty completion set immediately.
- `evictAllContentCaches()` — drop every active content key's cache. Counterpart to `interactiveStepStorage.clearAll`.

Hydration is lazy and per-section. Preview-mode content keys (`block-editor://preview/...`, `devtools`) bypass storage writes entirely — the in-memory cache still updates so ephemeral preview UI keeps reacting.

## Reset paths must evict the cache

The completion store keeps a module-scope cache (entries + hydration markers + version counters) that outlives any single component. Every path that clears persisted progress MUST also evict the cache, or live subscribers will keep rendering the prior "completed" snapshot until they remount.

Known reset sites (each pairs the storage clear with a cache eviction):

- `useContentReset` (docs-panel "Reset guide") — `interactiveStepStorage.clearAllForContent` + `evictContentCache`.
- `useGuidePreviewProgress.reset` (block-editor preview reset) — `interactiveStepStorage.clearAllForContent` + `evictContentCache`.
- `learning-paths.hook.ts` per-path reset — `interactiveStepStorage.clearAllForContent` + `evictContentCache` (URL and bundled branches).
- `MyLearningTab.handleResetAll` (global "Reset progress") — `interactiveStepStorage.clearAll` + `evictAllContentCaches`.

Adding a new reset path: pair the storage clear with the corresponding eviction.

## Section reducer — minimal state

`section-state.ts` owns one bit: `acknowledged: true | null` (the #842 gate). Cursor is a pure derivation of `(stepIds, completedSet)` via `computeCursor(stepIds, completed)`; the completion set comes from `useSectionCompletion`. Reducer actions:

- `RESTORE` — `{ acknowledged }`. Mount-only.
- `ACKNOWLEDGE` — `{ completedCount }`. Refused when `completedCount === 0` (#842 Bug 1 structural invariant).
- `CLEAR_ACK` — fired by every reset path (single-step redo, section reset, run-section restart) so re-completing always re-triggers the gate.

The store handles completion writes; the reducer coordinates the ack bit. Call sites in `interactive-section.tsx` always do "store write THEN dispatch" so the ack-rejected-when-empty invariant is enforced by call-site sequence + reducer guard.

## Step-type registry — single source for type metadata

`src/components/interactive-tutorial/step-type-registry.ts` lists every tracked interactive step type via `STEP_TYPE_SCHEMAS`. Each schema carries:

- `kind` — runtime discriminant
- `parseTypeKey` — the `ParsedElement.type` string the JSON parser emits
- `idPrefix` — stepId numbering prefix
- `refTarget` — where the section stores ref callbacks
- `toStepInfoExtension(props)` / `toEnhancedProps(ctx)` — section orchestration glue

`STEP_TYPE_PARSE_KEYS` (derived from the schemas) drives `content-renderer.tsx`'s `INTERACTIVE_STEP_TYPES` set. Adding a new step type means editing the registry and `section-child-classifier.ts`'s `INTERACTIVE_STEP_COMPONENT_TYPES` — see `.cursor/rules/tracked-step-types.mdc` for the full checklist.

## Unified progress event

`src/global-state/progress-events.ts` defines the unified `pathfinder:progress` event:

```ts
type ProgressEventDetail =
  | { kind: 'step'; stepId; sectionId?; completed; reason }
  | { kind: 'section'; sectionId; completed; percentage? }
  | { kind: 'guide'; contentKey; percentage; hasProgress };
```

Listeners use `subscribeProgressEvent(detail => ...)`. The store fires `kind: 'step'` from `markStepCompleted` / `resetStep`, `kind: 'guide'` from its `persistSection` writes. `interactive-section.tsx` fires `kind: 'section'` when the section transitions to a terminal state. The four legacy events (`interactive-step-completed`, `section-completed`, `interactive-section-completed`, `interactive-progress-saved`) are gone.

The orphan `step-auto-skipped` listener at `step-checker.hook.ts:746` was removed in C3 — there were no dispatchers anywhere in the repo.

`interactive-progress-cleared` (dispatched by `handleResetSection` and `useContentReset`) is the one remaining legacy event — it still drives ephemeral preview / alignment UI and will fold into `kind: 'guide'` with `hasProgress: false` once those listeners migrate.

## Tab loader

`docs-panel.tsx` exposes `loadTab(tabId, url, options?)` as the unified entry point. It dispatches to the legacy `loadTabContent` / `loadDocsTabContent` pair internally based on `shouldUseDocsLoader` + `packageInfo`. The previous explicit branches in `initializeRestoredActiveTab`, `setActiveTab`, `reloadActiveTab`, and `useContentReset` are gone.

## Content-key resolution

`src/global-state/content-key.ts` is the typed module that owns `getContentKey()`. It reads from the typed module state first, falling back to the legacy `window.__DocsPluginActiveTabUrl` / `__DocsPluginContentKey` globals so consumers can migrate piecemeal.

## Importing the types

Each layer owns its own types — there is no central re-export module. Import directly from the authoritative location:

- `StepCompletionEntry`, `GuideProgress`, `UseStepCompletionResult` — `src/global-state/completion-store.ts`
- `ProgressEventDetail` — `src/global-state/progress-events.ts`
- `CompletionReason` — `src/requirements-manager` (barrel)
- `InteractiveElementData`, `InteractiveActionType` — `src/types/interactive.types.ts`
- `SectionState`, `SectionAction`, `computeCursor`, `deriveSectionState` — `src/components/interactive-tutorial/section-state.ts`

## Section-completed requirement gate

`section-completed:<sectionId>` requirements are evaluated by `src/requirements-manager/checks/section-completed-check.ts`. It reads `sectionDoneStorage` first (mount-independent — works for unmounted virtualized sections, cross-milestone gates, conditional branches not yet rendered), then falls back to the legacy `#sectionId.completed` DOM check for the transitional window before the async storage write resolves. Lives in the engines tier (not `lib/dom`) because the check is domain-aware — it knows about content keys and the completion-store persistence namespace.
